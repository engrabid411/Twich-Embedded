== Description ==

Twitch Embedded is a simple plugin that allows you to embed Twitch.tv streams and chats on your Wordpress website.

You can without any programming skills embed Twitch streams with an iframe or the object tag. You can customize each
shortcode or just simply provide the channel name if you don't care or just want to embed alot of streams fast. The
plugin creates a new menu where you'll find all accepted parameters and a few examples.

Features:

*   Iframe [twitch channel="CHANNEL_NAME" mode="iframe"] VS. Object [twitch channel="CHANNEL_NAME" mode="object"]
*   Easy chat embed, [twitch channel="CHANNEL_NAME" get="chat"]
*   Customize how everything looks with just a few parameters, [twitch channel="CHANNEL_NAME" width="200px" height="200px" class="my_custom_class"
*   Set autoplay and volume options when using object, [twitch channel="CHANNEL_NAME" mode="object" autoplay="true" volume="30"]
